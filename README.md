# LilypondEngravings
Source code for my engravings of scores using GNU LilyPond

This repository stores source code for engravings I have made of public domain pieces. PDF files will be available from IMSLP. Engraving done using GNU LilyPond.

Usually, I will be engraving public domain pieces, and my editions released under CC BY-SA 4.0. ***HOWEVER, NOT ALL SCORES HAVE THIS LICENSING. COPYRIGHT NOTICES ARE IN THE HEADER OF THE SOURCE CODE AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST AND LAST PAGES OF THE PDF. READ THEM TO KNOW WHICH LICENSE TO FOLLOW.***

Finished scores that have been proofread and uploaded (or in the process of uploading) to IMSLP are located in `final/`, scores that have been engraved but need to be proofread go in `proofreading/`, and scores that are in progress are in `WIP/`.
